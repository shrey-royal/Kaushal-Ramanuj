2. Multiple Inheritance : 1 child, 2 or more parents
3. Multilevel Inheritance : 1 child, 1 parent, 1 grandparent
4. Hierarchical Inheritance : 2 or more child, 1 parent
5. Hybrid Inheritance : Combination of any two or more inheritance

syntax: 
class childclassname : accessspecifier parentclassname
{
    //body of child class
};
