Exceptions:
> Runtime errors which causes the program to terminate itself are called exceptions.

Exception handling: 

> Exception Handling in C++ is a process to handle runtime errors. We perform exception handling so the normal flow of the application can be maintained even after runtime errors.

> In C++, exception is an event or object which is thrown at runtime. All exceptions are derived from std::exception class. It is a runtime error which can be handled. If we don't handle the exception, it prints exception message and terminates the program.

try: it consist of the code that may or may not be the cause of the exception.
catch: if try block throws an exception then the catch block will handle it.
throw: it is used to throw an exception explicity.

two types of exceptions: 
1. Built-in Exceptions
2. User-Defined Exceptions
